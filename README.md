<b>1 - Outliers</b> - Exercise showing the usage of IQR to filter out outliers from a set and the differences from a boxplot before and after the removal. Also shows how to filter and pinpoint exactly which points have been removed.

<b>2 - K-means for auto binning</b> - Usage of a sklearn.kmeans model to cluster observations, so that the desired number of bins be automatically selected, in a balanced format, without manual choices. The notebook shows from manual binning until the automatic, kmeans binning.
